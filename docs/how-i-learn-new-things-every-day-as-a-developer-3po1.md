# How I learn new things every day as a developer

Dealing with new technology is our daily basis requirement in the tech world and sometimes it's tough to learn new things when you have so much work to do. Here are some tips that I have learned to keep you on the path of learning new things every day that are easy to adapt.
No further delay, let's jump into it.

## Having a habit of reading news aboutÂ tech

## Build your application with new tech you justÂ learn

One of the best ways to understand the new tech is to practice it.
Try to build a simple application when started to learn new things. And when you get more used to it, digging around some advanced ways, trying some different approaches outside of the document, and playing around with things you have learned then you achieve more knowledge about the new tech than ever.

## Join tech communities

With develop of social networks, it is not hard to find a group of people who have the same interest in the tech that you want to learn. For example, you can easily find a lot of React groups on Facebook, Twitter, or Medium.
Find and join them, digging for group topics and you can have a lot of knowledge from there. (also lot of new friends ðŸ˜‰)
Communities are also a great place for questions/answers if you got something stuck on your learning path and need some help.

## Take note of everything youÂ learned

Make documents every time you had a chance to learn new things.
Take good and careful notes to show that you have a full understanding of the concept and behavior of the tech you learn. This is also a good approach for finding where to remind in case you forget anything.

## Explore trendingÂ tech
One cool way to learn new tech things besides reading tech articles is exploring some current trending tech. That way you can see people in the tech world currently focus on which tech and see which one match you.
Some resources to explore trending technologies:

- [Github trending repositories](https://github.com/trending)
