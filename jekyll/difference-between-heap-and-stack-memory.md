Memory management decides whether your software feels instant or sluggish and whether it stays stable under load. The stack offers a tightly managed region for call frames and short-lived data, while the heap handles dynamic allocations that outlive a single function. Knowing how runtimes carve up memory, reclaim it, and fail when limits are exceeded is critical when you optimize latency, debug crashes, or design high-throughput services.

> **At a glance**
> - Programs split memory into segments: text, data, BSS, stack, and heap, each serving different lifetimes.
> - Stack allocation is LIFO; pushing and popping call frames is effectively free but limited by a per-thread size cap.
> - Heap allocation supports arbitrary lifetimes and sizes but requires bookkeeping, which introduces fragmentation and GC or manual free costs.
> - Deep recursion or large stack objects trigger stack overflows long before the process exhausts total RAM.
> - Profiling tools and allocator options help balance performance, safety, and memory footprint for your workload.

## Program memory layout

Operating systems load binaries into a predictable layout. The text segment stores executable instructions. The data and BSS segments hold global variables (initialized and uninitialized respectively). The stack grows downward from high addresses as each thread pushes call frames, while the heap grows upward as the allocator satisfies dynamic requests.

`ulimit -s` on Linux reports the maximum stack size for shells you spawn. Typical defaults range from 1 MB on embedded systems to 8 MB or more on servers. Heaps, by contrast, grow until they hit OS-imposed address space limits or allocator policies.

## Stack allocation characteristics

Stack frames contain function parameters, return addresses, saved registers, and local variables whose size is known at compile time. Because frames always pop in reverse call order, compilers only adjust the stack pointer to reserve or free memory—a few instructions with no fragmentation concerns.

```cpp
// stack_demo.cpp
void calculateSum() {
    int a = 10;        // Stored on stack
    int b = 20;        // Stored on stack
    int result = a + b; // Also on stack
}

int main() {
    calculateSum();
    return 0;
}
```

Compilation emits prologue and epilogue instructions that subtract or add to the stack pointer. Risks surface when recursion goes too deep or locals become too large, producing stack overflows. Multithreaded applications must remember that every thread gets its own stack, so creating thousands of threads multiplies the reserved stack space.

## Heap allocation characteristics

The heap enables dynamic data structures whose lifetimes cross function boundaries: containers, caches, actors, and more. Allocation strategies differ by language—`malloc`/`free`, `new`/`delete`, arenas, or garbage collectors—but all track metadata alongside user objects.

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> buildHistogram() {
    auto data = std::make_unique<int[]>(1024); // Allocated on heap
    // populate data...
    return std::vector<int>(data.get(), data.get() + 1024);
}
```

Heap allocations cost more than stack pushes because allocators search for suitably sized blocks, possibly split them, and later merge free space. Fragmentation leads to wasted memory and page faults. Managed runtimes mitigate leaks with tracing or reference-counting garbage collectors, but GC pauses still matter for latency-sensitive services.

## Managing memory safely

- **Prefer automatic storage when lifetimes are simple.** Local variables and small buffers belong on the stack when they do not escape the function.
- **Use RAII or smart pointers in manual environments.** In C++ or Rust, wrappers such as `std::unique_ptr` or ownership semantics guarantee `delete`/`drop` when scopes end.
- **Tune garbage collectors.** In Java, Go, or .NET, adjust heap size, generation thresholds, and pause targets to control throughput versus latency.
- **Adopt arenas or pools for hot paths.** Preallocating blocks and recycling them minimizes fragmentation and system calls for workloads like request handling.
- **Measure with profilers.** Tools such as `perf`, `heaptrack`, or language-specific profilers expose allocation hotspots, GC time, and stack usage.

## Choosing between stack and heap

Ask three guiding questions:

1. **Does the data escape the current scope?** If not, stack allocation avoids bookkeeping entirely.
2. **Is the size known at compile time and modest?** Fixed-size structs or arrays remain stack-friendly; large buffers risk overflows.
3. **Do you need shared ownership?** Heaps support objects referenced from multiple places, especially across threads or callbacks.

Real systems mix strategies. A network server might parse headers into stack buffers for speed, store active sessions on the heap, and recycle arenas per request to bound fragmentation.

## Design and trade-offs

| Option            | Pros                                              | Cons                                                     | Use when |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Stack allocation  | Near-zero allocation cost, cache-hot, automatic cleanup | Limited size per thread, unsafe for large or escaping data | Data is small, short-lived, and scoped to a function |
| Heap allocation   | Arbitrary lifetime and size, sharable across threads | Higher latency per allocation, fragmentation, requires GC or manual frees | Objects outlive callers or require shared ownership |
| Arena/pool allocators | Predictable latency, reuse memory, reduce fragmentation | Require upfront sizing, need explicit reset semantics | Hot paths need deterministic allocation costs |

## Questions

1. How would you detect and mitigate stack overflows in a recursive algorithm that must handle untrusted input depth?
2. What profiling signals tell you it is time to introduce a custom allocator rather than relying on the default heap?
